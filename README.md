100 Prisoners Riddle Simulator
====

Monte Carlo simulation of the [100 Prisoners Riddle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem) that shows 
the success rate for different strategies.

**Problem Statement**
> The director of a prison offers 100 death row prisoners, who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance. A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers. The director randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer. The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50 drawers in any order. The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every prisoner finds his number in one of the drawers, all prisoners are pardoned. If just one prisoner does not find his number, all prisoners die. Before the first prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may discuss strategy â€” but may not communicate once the first prisoner enters to look in the drawers. What is the prisoners' best strategy?

## How to run

*Requires: Python 3.10.x or above*

Just run `python3 main.py random` to try a random strategy or `python3 main.py loop` to try the loop strategy.

## Command line options

The program accepts the following parameters in the following order:

```
strategy: can be 'loop' or 'random'.

number of attempts: how many times the simulation should run. Default 1000.

number of prisoners: number of prisoners looking for their number. Default 100.

number of boxes opened: how many boxes each prisoner is allowed to open in order to find their number. Default 50.

verbose: if set to true, additional information is shown in the output. Default False.
```

## Adding more strategies

To try your own custom strategy you need to 

1. Add a function to `strategies.py` with the following signature:
```
(given_prisoner_number: int, boxes: list[int], n_boxes_selected: int) -> Tuple[int, bool]

    given_prisoner_number : int
        The number of the prisoner attempting to find his number.
    boxes : list[int]
        A list with the values [0, n_prisoners) shuffled.
    n_boxes_selected : int
        The number of boxes a prisoner can open in order to find their number.

    returns : Tuple[int, bool]
        The number of boxes opened, success/failure
```
2. Add a suitable key and the function reference to the `strategies` dictionary at the end of the file.

You can then call the strategy from the main program as the 1st argument.
